        Welcome to My Personal Website. I am so happy to tell you about me through this website, I hope you will enjoy knowing about me!
        I am a young boy born and raised in Congo Brazzaville and I am 22 years old. I like to play Basketball when I am free form my daily occupations.
        I am from a family of 7 people where I am the first boy and I love my family so much. I like knowing new things about our Lord Jesus Christ and His teachings.
        I love to go to church and meet new people every sunday. I love the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My favorite food is chicken 'fried chicken with saucce' I also like to eat bananas, those are my favorite fruits.
        When it comes to cook, I do not really know how to cook, but I like to cook even though I do not cook very well. I love being taught to cook, because one of my best wishes is to know how to cook someday and do it for my family.

      <p>
        This website is all about me and my interests. I hope you find it interesting! Here you will have a brief resume of my capacities and skills. I am a student in computer programming and I am looking forward to getting my bachelor's degree
        in applied technology. I am a hard worker and I dislike failure, I always want to be on top of myself and I am difficult to be satisfied by myself. I have studied in marien ngouabi university,
        but I did not study there for a long time because I did not find my major there. So I decided to get my enrollment in BYU where I found my major which is computer programming.
        I hope when reading this brief Overview of me you will find it intersting and maybe offer me a job and I promise that if that is so, I will be a very hard worker, you will not be deceived upon me.
